Notes:

* Based on upstream/master from July 2020 because OLED behavior works best here. Otherwise the slave OLED has weird behavior: turns off, half-freezes, or displays out-of-sync with master OLED.


Features from soundmonster:

* Modern OLED support (many thanks to @drashna):
  * Proper orientation
  * Graphic layer indicator â†‘ â†“
  * Graphic modifier indicator âŒ˜ â‡§ âŒ¥  âŒƒ
* Similar enough to the default keymap so you can easily port your custom keymap to it
* Mac-friendly (Command and Option on the thumbs)
* Vim-friendly (Esc, `:` and Ctrl on the thumbs)
* Full per-key RGB Matrix support out of the box (you still have to go through the nightmare of soldering yourself though ðŸ˜‰)
